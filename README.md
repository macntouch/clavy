# Clavy [![](https://travis-ci.org/atomiomi/clavy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/atomiomi/clavy/builds)

Clavy is a handy task manager that helps you to reach goals. The name was got from 'clever' word. That means it is intelligent and can help to accomplish various tasks. Our idea is to make universal assistant which will plan your day. All that you need to do is just define deadlines and precedence of each task. Afterwards our system evenly disperses all tasks between current day and its deadlines. If it's necessary you can drag tasks on day that is more convenient to you.

We know that some major goals can't be reached without help. So it will be useful if it is possibility to share tasks with friend or colleagues. In Clavy just select particular task and send it to another user, you will be notified about his answer(accept/refuse).
